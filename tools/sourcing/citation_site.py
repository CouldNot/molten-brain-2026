"""The address of one *citation*, so a verdict can name a claim instead of a quote.

A quote id is a content hash, so one sentence reaching two claims is one id. That is
deliberate (the excerpt table stays deduplicated, and `provenance` / `pipeline` already
ride the citation rather than the quote for exactly this reason), but it leaves the
judging pass with no way to say the useful thing: *this sentence backs the binding and
not the class*. Judged by quote, such a sentence is either kept on a claim it does not
support or stripped off one it does.

A **site** is that missing address: a short, stable, human-readable string naming one
place a quote is cited from.

    drug:brexpiprazole/half_life
    drug:quetiapine/formulations[xr]/brands[Seroquel XR]
    metabolite:desmethyldiazepam/half_life
    drug:diazepam/metabolites[desmethyldiazepam]
    drug:clozapine/bindings[5ht2a:antagonist]
    drug:fluoxetine/enzymes[cyp2d6:inhibitor]
    receptor:5ht1a/classification[family]
    receptor:5ht1a/locations[amygdala]
    receptor:h1/effects[antagonism:sedation]
    receptor:5ht1e/effects
    projection:raphe_R->hippocampus_R

A site with no ``[key]`` names a whole facet of its owner: ``receptor:5ht1e/effects`` is
the address of an owner-level UNKNOWN search (``data_generators/unknown.py``: no searched
source states any effect of acting on it), the facet whose members would otherwise be
``effects[<mode>:<effect>]``.

It is written for a reader, not for a parser: a judge is shown one per claim and answers
with the ones that fail, so a site that cannot be read back by a person is useless even
if a program can resolve it.

**Two callers, one grammar, and that is the whole point of this module.**
`recheck_quotes.py` labels each claim it reconstructs out of the *emitted* data, and
`demote_quotes.py` recognizes the same site while walking the *authoring* files, whose
shapes differ (a receptor's regions are nested under the receptor in `receptors.jsonl`
and under a corpus-keyed cache in `location_sources.json`). Writing the grammar once and
resolving it twice is what keeps the two ends from drifting apart into a silent no-op.
Divergence stays loud rather than silent: an applier that is handed a site it never
visited says so instead of skipping it (see ``demote_quotes.py``).

Stdlib only; authoring helper, not served. Built with the help of Claude Code.
