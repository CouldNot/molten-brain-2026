"""Where one corpus **denies** what another states (the ``contradicted`` badge).

Every other doubt this package records is about a quote's *reach*: the sentence is on
the page, but it may not be about this node (see ``uncertainty.py``). This one is about
a quote's *truth*, and it is the only kind the dataset cannot settle: two graded,
quote-gated sources say opposite things, and picking a winner would mean asserting a
judgement neither corpus makes.

The recurring shape, and the reason this file exists at all, is **in vitro vs in vivo**.
A prescriber's manual states an interaction as a bare fact ("Inhibits CYP3A4"); the
pharmacology literature qualifies it ("in vivo, ... do not significantly affect the
activity of ... CYP3A4"). Both sentences are real. The laboratory effect exists and the
bedside effect does not, and a terse bullet has no room to say so. Dropping the row would
hide what the manual prints; keeping it silently would let the reader believe something
the better-evidenced source contradicts. So the row ships, flagged, with the denial
quoted underneath it.

**Hand-curated, unlike the three derived flags in** ``uncertainty.py``. A scan for
"negation sentence naming an isoform this drug modulates" over the stored articles
returns six pairs, of which three are not contradictions at all:

* a caveat scoped to two named substrates ("bupropion does not seem to affect the
  concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates fluoxetine and paroxetine") is a *detail of* the
  inhibition, not a denial of it;
* an exception clause ("interactions are considered unlikely ... **with possible
  exceptions such as** CYP2A6 substrates") actually affirms the interaction while its
  words read as a negation.

At a 50% false-positive rate the derivation would encode its own errors as doubt, which
is worse than the silence it replaces. So each entry below was read in context and
written by hand, and the ordinary quote gate (``check_data.py`` family 5) still confirms
it verbatim on the cited page, exactly like the claim it doubts.

One table, :data:`CONTRADICTIONS`, keyed by the doubted node's **citation site** (the
grammar of ``tools/sourcing/citation_site.py``, the same address a judge verdict names),
each mapping to the denying source(s). Any node-shaped site of any kind can be doubted
with a data-only edit, at the precision the site gives: the metabolism row
(``drug:<id>/enzymes[<enzyme>:<role>]``) or only its tier sub-claim (``.../strength``), one
receptor classification attribute (``receptor:<id>/classification[<attr>]``), one binding
of several on a target (``drug:<id>/bindings[<target>:<action>]``), a per-parent metabolite
link (``drug:<id>/metabolites[<metabolite>]``), a receptor effect, a workup row, and so on.
A flat facet stored as ``*_sources`` on its owner (``half_life``, ``tmax``) is not a node
dict and cannot be named (``citation_site.node_index``).

``generate_data.py`` raises if a site names no emitted node (or two), and ``check_data.py``
fails on the same, so a re-run of a fetcher cannot silently strip the flag and leave the
contradiction unmarked.
